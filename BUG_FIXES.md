# Bug Fixes Applied to Routes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Configuration File
- **Problem**: `app/core/config.py` was deleted, causing import errors
- **Solution**: Recreated the config file with all necessary API keys and voice options
- **Files**: `app/core/config.py`

### 2. Missing TTS Service
- **Problem**: `app/services/tts_service.py` was deleted, breaking TTS functionality
- **Solution**: Recreated the TTS service with SimpleTTSService class and backward compatibility
- **Files**: `app/services/tts_service.py`

### 3. Missing Recommender Service
- **Problem**: `app/services/recommender.py` didn't exist, causing import errors
- **Solution**: Created a mock recommender service for testing
- **Files**: `app/services/recommender.py`

### 4. Import Errors in Routes
- **Problem**: Routes were trying to import non-existent services
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling and service availability checks
- **Files**: `app/api/routes.py`

### 5. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: Required packages were not installed
- **Solution**: Added missing dependencies to requirements.txt
- **Files**: `requirements.txt`

## Key Changes Made

### Routes (`app/api/routes.py`)
- Added service availability checks with graceful error handling
- Added health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added proper type checking for request parameters

### Configuration (`app/core/config.py`)
- Recreated with all necessary API keys
- Added voice options for different TTS providers
- Added AWS configuration
- Added Redis configuration

### TTS Service (`app/services/tts_service.py`)
- Recreated with SimpleTTSService class
- Added support for multiple TTS providers (Play.ht, ElevenLabs, AWS Polly)
- Added fallback mechanism
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `openai==1.90.0` for Llama API integration
- Added `python-multipart==0.0.9` for file uploads
- Added video processing dependencies

## Testing

Created `test_routes.py` to verify all endpoints are working:
- Health check endpoint
- Recommend endpoint
- Summarize endpoint
- TTS endpoint
- Video perspectives endpoint
- Video voices endpoint

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file with:
```
LLAMA4_API_BASE=https://api.llama-api.com
LLAMA4_API_KEY=your_llama_api_key_here
PLAYHT_API_KEY=your_playht_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   python test_routes.py
   ```

3. **Check the API docs:**
   Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Status

✅ All import errors fixed
✅ Routes are now functional
✅ Proper error handling implemented
✅ Health check endpoint added
✅ Test script created
✅ Dependencies updated
